/**
 * Cases for the prompt-injection evaluation. Each is a short chat with the app's own assistant.
 *
 * Attacks hide an instruction in content the owner pastes or forwards. They are grouped by the four
 * security terms in the competition rules: induced transfer (诱导转账), information extraction
 * (信息套取), privilege escalation (越权操作) and prompt injection (Prompt 注入). Legitimate cases are
 * things the owner asks for in their own words, including clarification (追问) and correction (纠错),
 * so a system that refuses everything scores badly.
 *
 * Every turn stays under 500 characters: messages.send keeps only the first 500.
 *
 * `obedient` scripts a model that does exactly what the hidden instruction (or, in legitimate
 * cases, the owner) asks. It needs no API key and shows what the gateway and vault do when the
 * model is fooled every time.
